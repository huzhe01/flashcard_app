# Library & Filters

The Library is your dashboard for managing your entire collection of flashcards.

## Statistics

At the top of the Library, you can see a quick overview:
*   **Total Cards**: All cards currently loaded.
*   **Mastered (Easy)**: Cards you've rated as Easy.
*   **Learning (Medium/Hard)**: Cards that need more work.

## Advanced Review Filters

Instead of studying everything at once, you can start a targeted session:

### 1. By Category
If your CSV has a "Category" column, you can select a specific topic (e.g., "English", "Math", "Coding") to focus on.

### 2. By Difficulty
Filter cards based on your past performance:
*   **New Only**: Study cards you haven't seen yet.
*   **Hard Only**: Review your most difficult cards.
*   **Medium Only**: Reinforce cards you're learning.

## Managing Data

*   **Import More**: Click to upload another CSV file locally.
*   **Clear Data**: Wipes all local data and reloads the default files from the code (useful if you've just pushed new files to GitHub).
