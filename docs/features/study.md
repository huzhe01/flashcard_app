# Study Mode

The Study Mode is the core of the application, designed to help you memorize information efficiently.

## Interface

*   **The Card**: Displays the "Front" (Question) initially. Click or press Space to flip to the "Back" (Answer).
*   **Progress Bar**: Shows your progress through the current session.
*   **Controls**: Buttons to navigate and rate difficulty.

## Difficulty Ratings

After flipping a card, rate how well you knew the answer:

*   **✅ Easy**: You knew it instantly. The card is marked as "Mastered".
*   **⚠️ Medium**: You knew it, but it took some thought.
*   **❌ Hard**: You didn't know it. **The card will be placed back at the end of the queue** so you see it again in the same session.
