# Future Roadmap 🚀

We are constantly improving the Flashcard App. Here is what we are planning to build next.

## 1. Smart Recommendation Engine (AI) 🤖
Instead of random shuffling, we will implement an intelligent algorithm to recommend cards based on your state.
*   **Context-Aware**: Recommend cards based on time of day (e.g., quick vocab in the morning, deep concepts at night).
*   **Forgetting Curve**: Automatically bring back cards you are about to forget (SuperMemo/Anki style).

## 2. Daily Push & Notifications 📅
*   **Daily Digest**: A "Card of the Day" pushed to your device.
*   **Reminders**: Gentle nudges to review your "Hard" cards if you haven't studied in a while.

## 3. Personalized Learning Path 🛤️
*   **Goal Setting**: Set a goal (e.g., "Learn 50 words this week") and track progress.
*   **Mood-Based Study**: Choose "Relaxed" mode for easy review or "Intense" mode for learning new difficult material.

## 4. Enhanced Analytics 📈
*   **Heatmaps**: Visualize your study streaks.
*   **Retention Rates**: See how well you are remembering different categories.
